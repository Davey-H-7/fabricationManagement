# Inventory Management
## MVP
To create a management app for a fabrication company:
  - items required for each order
  - Orders which items will be assigned to
  - Progress tracking for status of items and complete orders


## Set Up
- clone the repository onto local machine

- In a terminal create database with name 'fabrication_inventory'

- To run the backend:
    -Open the project 'inventoryService' in IDE such as IntelliJ
    -Run CoursebookingsApplication.java (this will run the DataLoader component to populate the database)

  - To run the frontend:
    -cd into folder 'inventoryFrontEnd' in the terminal
    -run command 'npm run dev'
